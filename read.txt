uint8 = 15 // 0 - 256 // 2^8 = 256

public = available for all
private = not available for the inherited contract
internal = available for the inherited contract
external = available only outside the contract - available for a user 

block.timestamp // global variable

variables inside the contract called state variable
variables inside the contract function called local variable

function example (...) public pure {...}

function with view modifier is a function that does not change the state variables but it uses it ex:
function example (...) public view {...}
